            <p class="cigars-production__text">Our modern and well-equipped cigar factories in Cuba do not rely
                solely on
                technologies. On the contrary, the
                making of cigars still requires human skills. Our employees are engaged in a craft and are supported by
                modern technologies. </p>

            <p class="quality-of-production__text">Before a wrapper is wound around a cigar, it passes through at
                least three hundred pairs of hands. You can
                trace the journey of your cigar from the tobacco leaf or even seed to the boxed cigar. We use the most
                modern approaches and only natural ingredients. </p>
