        <p class="cigars-production__text">Our modern and well-equipped cigar factories in Cuba do not rely
            solely on
            technologies. On the contrary, the
            making of cigars still requires human skills. Our employees are engaged in a craft and are supported by
            modern technologies. </p>

        <h4 class="quality_of_production__title">QUALITY THAT CAN'T BE OVERESTIMATED</h4>
        <p class="quality_of_production__text">Before a wrapper is wound around a cigar, it passes through at
            least three hundred pairs of hands. You can
            trace the journey of your cigar from the tobacco leaf or even seed to the boxed cigar. We use the most
            modern approaches and only natural ingredients. </p>
